# Collection of statistics to understand the instantaneous behaviour of the underlying network 

## Problem Definition
The state of the art congestion control algorithms are based on End to End packet statistics. Leveraging the network feedback for congestion control is another promising dimension, but the catch is the availability of network statistics at one place. Software Defined Networking can mitigate
this limitation and hence be a pillar for network suggested TCP Congestion control.

##  Version 1 - StatCollection from all switch interfaces using Python script.
### Modules
#### 1. Topology Generation [Source code](https://gitlab.com/IIITB_SDN_2017/MT2016119_MT2016120_StatCollection/blob/master/src/MT2016120_Sabari_Nathan/Generator.py)
* A generic topology generator. 
* Input is a CSV file whose 1st column specifies all nodes
    * Hosts' name should start with _'h'_
    * Switches' name should start with _'s'_
    * Controllers' name should start with _'c'_
* Since the internet can have different controllers controlling different part of network, we have support for different controllers. With a many to one mapping between Switch and controllers.
* Which controller controller controls which switch can also be specified.
* 2nd column onwards specifies the nodes that are neighbours of the node in th e corresponding row's first column.
* Currently the host-switch links have 5Mbps link with a delay of 5ms and the switch to switch links have 100Mbps link with 7.5ms delay.
* Make sure you are in the corresponding directory + followed all [set-up instructions](https://gitlab.com/IIITB_SDN_2017/MT2016119_MT2016120_StatCollection/blob/master/src/MT2016120_Sabari_Nathan/Setup%20instructions.md)
* Run the script using `sudo python Generator.py`
* Once the script runs, it generates 4 different files  (3 Python scripts and 1 CSV file).
    * topo_consolidated.py
    * stat_consolidated.py
    * sniffer_consolidated.py
    * Switch2PortMapping.csv

#### 2. Sniffer file [Source code](https://gitlab.com/IIITB_SDN_2017/MT2016119_MT2016120_StatCollection/blob/master/src/MT2016120_Sabari_Nathan/snif.py)
* This file is generated by the previous step. 
* Sniffs TCP segments from all the active interfaces of all switches in the Mininet emulation environment.
* Every packet is processed to check if the hextuple (SourceIP - Destination IP - Source TCP Port - Destination TCP Port - SwitchID - Switch's PortID) is unique.
* If unique, it is recorded by sending to MySQL running at an external system. 
* This helps in figuring out the path taken by each TCP flow. 

#### 3. StatCollector 
* 

#### 4. Web service to query 


## Running the project
* `sudo python topo_consolidated.py`
* `xterm <any switch name>`
* `sudo python sniffer_consolidated.py`
* In case you want to use the version 1 of this project, 
    * `xterm <any switch name>`
    * Make sure MySQL server is running and accepting connections
    * In the xterm window run `sudo python stat_consolidated.py`
* In case you want to run the version 2 of this project @maneesha
 
## Issues to be addressed
1. Communicating the node statistics from each intermediate network device to SDN controller.
2. A web-based platform at the controller which shall respond to queries raised by the systems who wish to perform network suggested congestion control.
3. The intelligent decisions that the client would make, such as changing the routing metric (Layer 3), changing the token replenishment rate of the token buckets (Layer 2), setting the congestion window of TCP (Layer 4).
