2. Identified the list of statistics present at the SDN controller that will be useful for the TCP congestion window manipulation.
3. Read about PCE - Path Computation Element (RFC 4655) and possible help it would bring in to the project. Found that PCE had to be run at another level. It was
found that PCE would be an overkill for classification of flows.
